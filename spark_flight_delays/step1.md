In this Hands on Lab we will look at the architecture of a data pipeline  that combines streaming data with machine learning and fast storage
to predict flight delays. You will see the end-to-end process required to build this application using Apache APIs for Kafka, Spark and other technologies.

***Wait about 5 minutes for Zeppelin to download and install. note this is temporary***

1. `ps -e -f | grep zeppelin`{{execute}}
2. Open Zeppelin in the toolbar tab
3. Open and run the Flight Delays Prediction notebook. ✈️

## Using Apache Spark SQL to explore the flight dataset.

These lab exercises use Spark in Apache Zeppelin notebooks. To run this exercise, click on the Zeppelin tab on the right. This should take you to a web browser with a list of notebooks, if you do not see the list, click refresh. Select the notebook FlightDelay1SparkDatasets, follow the Zeppelin notebook instructions. Click on the READY > to run the Spark code paragraphs.
