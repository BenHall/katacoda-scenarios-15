The MapR Data Platform delivers dataware for AI and analytics. Dataware effectively handles the diversity of data types, data access, and ecosystem tools needed to manage data as an enterprise resource regardless of the underlying infrastructure or location.

With the MapR Data Platform, users can store, manage, process, and analyze all data - including files, tables, and streams from operational, historical, and real-time data sources - with mission-critical reliability to meet production SLAs. 

The MapR Data Platform includes a wide variety of analytics and open source tools such as Apache Hadoop, Apache Spark, and Apache Drill with real-time database capabilities, global event streaming, and scalable enterprise storage to power a new generation of Big Data applications.
With support for POSIX, cutting-edge AI and ML tools like new Python ML libraries can run natively on the same cluster as other analytics and leverage the power of the MapR Data Platform. MapR solves the challenges of complex data environments by managing data and its ecosystem across multiple clouds and containerized infrastructures.

In this scenario you will become familiar with the MapR Data Platform by interacting with Apache Spark SQL, Streaming, Machine learning, MapR Event Store for Kafka, and MapR Database on a single-node MapR cluster.
